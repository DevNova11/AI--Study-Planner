📘 Study Planner App — Design Documentation
🎯 Product Vision
A mobile app that helps students plan, track, and optimize study sessions with a clear, modern UI and smooth UX.
The goal is to turn a messy homework list and schedule into a structured, productive day-by-day plan that feels encouraging rather than overwhelming.
